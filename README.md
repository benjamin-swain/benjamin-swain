### Hi, I'm Benjamin

I'm a software engineer with eight years of experience building distributed systems, cloud infrastructure, and large-scale data pipelines for autonomous vehicle and backend applications.

Iâ€™m currently the software development lead for the team behind the map update API powering Super Cruise, GMâ€™s hands-free driving system, and the primary data source for over 200,000 vehicles.

Because most of my work lives in private repositories, my public profile does not reflect the full scope of my contributions. Below is a snapshot of my activity from 2024:
